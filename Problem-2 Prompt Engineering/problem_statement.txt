Problem Title: AI-Powered Health Awareness Chatbot for Rural Communities

Problem Description and Scope:
Rural communities often lack access to accurate, timely health information due to geographical isolation, lack of nearby hospitals, and low health literacy. In such areas, people often rely on word-of-mouth, myths, or outdated practices. There is a critical need for a reliable, conversational solution that can offer first-level health awareness and preventive care guidance.

Social Impact and Significance:
This chatbot will act as a virtual health assistant, helping underserved populations:
- Understand basic health symptoms and actions
- Avoid misinformation (e.g., myths around turmeric milk curing COVID-19)
- Promote preventive practices like hygiene and vaccinations
By doing this in regional languages like Kannada, the tool ensures inclusion and accessibility, contributing to improved public health outcomes.

Programming Challenges Involved:
- Designing prompts to ensure medically accurate but non-diagnostic advice
- Translating responses into simple, culturally sensitive language
- Handling multilingual interactions with tone adaptation
- Implementing a lightweight frontend accessible even on low-end devices

Target Audience and Use Cases:
- Rural families with limited healthcare access
- ASHA workers (Accredited Social Health Activists)
- NGOs and state health departments
Use cases include:
- Fever or injury at home: what to do before reaching a hospital
- Daily hygiene tips for children
- Maternal health awareness and vaccinations
- Busting local myths about food, herbs, and diseases

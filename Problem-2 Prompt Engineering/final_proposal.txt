Final Proposal: Health Awareness Chatbot using Prompt Engineering

Summary:
We propose building a conversational chatbot that provides localized and safe health awareness content for rural users using LLMs. The project uses prompt engineering to guide the language model in responding accurately, simply, and in a culturally appropriate way.

Why This Matters:
This tackles the real-world problem of health misinformation and lack of access in rural areas. By using natural language conversations and regional languages, the chatbot can educate, assist, and empower underserved communities.

Prompt Engineering Role:
Carefully designed prompts handle translation, tone control, misinformation handling, and safety messaging. Experiments prove that effective prompting can turn general-purpose LLMs into context-aware health assistants.

Future Extensions:
- Integration with government health schemes
- Support for more languages
- Voice input/output for illiterate users

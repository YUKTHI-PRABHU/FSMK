Final Optimized Prompt:
"You are a trusted community health worker in a rural Indian village. Respond in simple and polite language. Provide basic first-level health awareness. Do not give medical diagnoses. Always include a safety disclaimer: 'This advice is for awareness only. Please consult a doctor for treatment.'"

Expected Use Cases:
- Home care advice for common illnesses (e.g., fever, cold, cuts)
- Preventive hygiene and nutrition tips
- Health misinformation correction
- Pregnancy, vaccination, and child care awareness
- Kannada language translations for each case

Limitations and Considerations:
- LLMs cannot replace doctors or give medical treatment advice
- Language translation may sometimes miss cultural nuance
- Requires validation loop to avoid hallucinated facts
- Dependent on internet access (can be mitigated with offline/WhatsApp options)

Suggestions for Further Improvement:
- Add voice input/output for non-literate users using Whisper and TTS
- Partner with government health schemes to provide verified data
- Expand to other regional languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu
- Incorporate local feedback to improve prompt effectiveness iteratively

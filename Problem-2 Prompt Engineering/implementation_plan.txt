Implementation Plan:

1. Define Use Cases:
   - Fever management at home
   - First aid guidance
   - Preventive care (e.g., hygiene, vaccinations)
   - Health myth busting
   - Maternal and child health FAQs

2. Tools and Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: Streamlit (for prototype) / WhatsApp interface (for real-world use)
   - Backend: Python + OpenAI GPT-3.5 API
   - Language Support: English, Kannada (via prompts)

3. Prompt Engineering:
   - Role-based prompting (e.g., "You are a trusted village health worker")
   - Tone control for empathy and simplicity
   - Context-aware prompts for regional diseases

4. Data Safety:
   - Avoid medical diagnoses
   - Add disclaimers to all LLM outputs
   - Validate with filters or human-in-the-loop where required

5. Testing and Feedback:
   - Conduct prompt testing with simulated user queries
   - Iterate based on hallucinations or vague responses

6. Optional:
   - Add voice-to-text support using Whisper for non-literate users

Technical Approach and Architecture:
The chatbot will use a frontend UI (web or mobile-friendly) integrated with a backend powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-3.5. Prompt engineering techniques will be used to control the tone, language, and safety of responses.

Architecture:
- Frontend: Streamlit or a WhatsApp-based interface (for real-world deployment)
- Backend: Python + OpenAI API
- Middleware: Prompt builder with context templates
- Translation Layer: Built-in LLM-based translation to Kannada
- Optional: Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) for voice interface

Key Components and Modules:
1. Prompt Engine – formats questions into medically-safe, empathetic LLM prompts.
2. Translation/Tone Adapter – adapts responses to simple, respectful regional language.
3. Misinformation Filter – identifies and addresses common rural health myths.
4. Interface Layer – chat UI for user interactions.
5. Logging Module – records responses for validation and improvement.

Implementation Timeline and Milestones:
- Week 1: Define key health scenarios + gather datasets
- Week 2: Design and test initial prompts
- Week 3: Integrate LLM backend with basic UI
- Week 4: Implement Kannada translation and tone refinements
- Week 5: Handle misinformation use cases + safety filter
- Week 6: Final prompt optimization + documentation

Potential Challenges and Solutions:
- Challenge: LLM might give overly medical or unsafe advice  
  Solution:Always use disclaimer prompts + restrict to awareness, not diagnosis  
- Challenge:Poor internet access in rural areas  
  Solution: Explore WhatsApp interface or SMS fallback  
- Challenge: Mistrust in AI  
  Solution: Partner with local health workers for co-usage

Resource Requirements:
- OpenAI API access or open-source LLM
- Streamlit or Twilio for UI
- Kannada translation datasets (if needed)
- Local health guides for factual reference

Prompt 1: Basic Fever Advice
Prompt: "You are a trusted health advisor in a village. What should a mother do if her child has a high fever and the hospital is far?"
Result: Provided hydration tips, wet cloth cooling, basic medicine info
Improved: Added conditions for when to seek help urgently

Prompt 2: Kannada Translation for Dengue Prevention
Prompt: "Translate this to Kannada in simple, respectful language: Keep your surroundings clean. Don’t allow water to stagnate. Use mosquito nets."
Result: Good translation, but too formal initially
Improved: Added instruction to speak like a local community worker

Prompt 3: COVID Misinformation Correction
Prompt: "A user says turmeric milk cures COVID. Gently correct them using WHO advice."
Result: Calm correction given, myth addressed, alternative suggested
Improved: Added a disclaimer prompt + advice to consult doctors

Prompt 4: Pregnancy Diet Query
Prompt: "A pregnant woman asks: Can I eat papaya during pregnancy?"
Result: LLM gave uncertain advice
Improved: Added a constraint: “Only respond if supported by verified medical sources. Otherwise, direct the user to a doctor.”

What Worked:
- Role-based and tone-specific prompts
- Translation instructions made results more culturally adapted

What Didn’t Work:
- Open-ended questions without context gave too vague or unsafe answers
- LLM occasionally gave unsafe home remedies (mitigated with filters)
